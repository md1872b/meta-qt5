Qt5 Long Term Support Commercial releases
=========================================

Qt 5.15 has moved to LTS mode where the releases starting with 5.15.3
are available only for commercial Qt users with appropriate license.

The Qt 5.15 LTS Commercial source code is available in the tqtc shadow
repositories and their LTS branches as described in
https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git#Getting_the_Qt_5.15_LTS_Commercial_source_code

The meta-qt5 layer can be used to build the LTS releases using the lts-5.15 branch.
In order to build the LTS release, you must have SSH access set up to the
Qt Gerrit as instructed in
